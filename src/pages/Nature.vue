    <h1>Pre-rendered HTML</h1>
    <p>Gridsome pre-renders HTML at build time (Generates static files). Gridsome sites can be hosted anywhere, even on a CDN. There is no need for a Node.js server.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Better Performance. Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.</li>
      <li>Higher Security. With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.</li>
      <li>Cheaper, Easier Scaling. When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.</li>
